# Contributing to the wiki

Before you open a new pull request, the are a few requirements
that need to be met, but they're not too unresonable.

## Contribution Process

1. Fork the project locally and make changes relevant to what
   you're trying to add/fix in a different branch

    - Your commit must have specific information about the change you
      made and what page you made the change to. Check the example below

            [iOS/macOS] Add new dependencies

    - If your commit adds a new page, use the following format

            [New] Add iOS/macOS building docs

    It's okay to forget any of this; it will be changed before being merged,
    but try to do this yourself

1. Create a new pull request for your change in your specific branch.
   While not an official requirement, please provide a small description
   of your change

Don't expect changes to merged and pushed to upstream quickly; while the
review process doesn't take long, it is not automatic. If you'd like to
have a higher chance for your changes to be merged faster, make sure that
your changes don't have any grammatical errors

Once all guidelines are met, your pull request will be merged and pushed to
upstream and your changes will be reflected. If you have any further questions
or concerns, join the official [Procursus Discord Server].
